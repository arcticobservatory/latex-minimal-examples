% Example of tweaking bibliography data with DeclareSourceMap
%
% This adjusts bibliography data as exported by an external bibliography
% management program (in this case Zotero), so that it works neatly with the
% Chicago Manual of Style reference format.
%
% It also replaces quotes in the title with the enquote macro from the csquotes
% package, so that quotes will nest properly inside the quoted title.
